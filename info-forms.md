If you have a form that needs to be filled out by us such as FMLA, camp or school physical forms, please drop off at the office and allow up to a week for completion. There is a $5 fee for forms filled out between appointments. All FMLA forms are $5. In addition, any forms that require a notary are $25. Please be aware we can not fax this type of paperwork directly to school or your employer due to HIPAA laws. We are happy to fax directly to you or you can pick the form up. If you need it sent back to you please drop off a stamped returned envelope with the form.
