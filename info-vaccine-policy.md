We firmly believe in vaccinations.   


At First State Pediatrics:


We firmly believe in the effectiveness of vaccines to prevent serious illness and to save lives.
We firmly believe in the safety of our vaccines.
We firmly believe that all children should receive all of the recommended vaccines according to the schedule published by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).
We firmly believe, based on all available literature, evidence, and current studies, that vaccines do not cause autism or other developmental disabilities.
All of our own children are vaccinated.
All of our physicians believe that vaccinating your children may be the single most important health-promoting and life-saving intervention that you can perform as parents. 


Due to this philosophy, our physicians do not provide medical care for families that do not vaccinate their children.


Our policy states:


All children must receive all routine vaccines recommended by the AAP and within the CDC guidelines for vaccination timeline. Flu vaccinations are also strongly recommended though not mandated.
Parents or caregivers who refuse vaccination for their children will be given a 1 month grace period to find another healthcare facility. If this is the case, please recognize that by not vaccinating you are putting your child at unnecessary risk for life-threatening illness and disability, even death.
CDC guidelines provide a window for when a specific vaccine should be given.  This allows sufficient flexibility in getting your child properly vaccinated.  We prefer to remain your childâ€™s Pediatricians and will not dismiss any family who is actively working to properly vaccinate their children.
