Please note that all balances are due within 30 billing days. Most families have a deductible to meet for non-preventive services. If so you will receive a bill from us in the mail after the claim is submitted through your insurance. If you have a health savings account card you can pay by phone during regular business hours, or drop in. All copayments and overdue payments are due before your child can be seen for an appointment. We appreciate your understanding.
