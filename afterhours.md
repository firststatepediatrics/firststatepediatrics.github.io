If you have an urgent question or concern that can not wait until regular office hours, such as if your child is very sick, injured, or if you are worried, please call your primary office main number (Hockessin: 302-235-1188 / Newark: 302-368-2501) and you will be connected to our After Hours nurse triage service. A physician from our practice is always available for emergencies that can not be handled by the on-call nurses. If you do not receive a return phone call within 30 minutes, please call again to ensure they have the correct return phone number.


We kindly request that you call during regular business hours for all routine questions, refills and appointment management.
