If you have spoken to our front desk staff and have an appointment with a doctor for telemedicine, please follow these steps. It is helpful if you are prepared with a flashlight, a thermometer, and are in a quiet, well lit location that has good WiFi.

**Step 1:** Please log into the patient portal, click on "MESSAGES" in the top toolbar. You must reply to the message asking for consent to telemedicine by replying with the words "I consent".

**Step 2:** If you are on your smartphone or tablet, please go into the SETTINGS and choose the BROWSER you intend to use to communicate with us with and ALLOW use of both the camera and microphone. You may need to close and open your browser for this to work. If you are on a camera equipped laptop or a computer with a webcam, please do the same. For Apple devices we have experienced the best results with the Safari web browser.

**Step 3:** **[Click this link to enter our Telemedicine waiting room](https://firststatepeds.doxy.me)**, choose the doctor you have an appointment with, enter your child's name and we will be with you shortly.
