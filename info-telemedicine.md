At this time (Fall/Winter 2022-2023) we are no longer providing Saturday morning telemedicine patient care due to licensing and insurance reasons. There are a number of local urgent care providers available to care for your child if they become unwell on the weekend or on a holiday. Please call to speak to the on-call nurse if you need assistance.
