---
Telemedicine appointments can be scheduled by calling the office or by speaking to the weekend nurse for Saturday acute care Telemedicine appointments (from 9AM to 12 PM on Saturday only). Several insurances including Highmark of Delaware, Aetna and Cigna are waiving co-pays and out-of-pocket deductible payments (“member cost sharing”) for Telemedicine visits due to the pandemic. Check with your insurance for details.

Concerns that are very amenable to telemedicine encounters include:

- Rashes / skin conditions
- Eye infections / irritation
- Seasonal allergy symptoms
- Minor cold symptoms
- Asthma medication management
- ADHD medication check-ins
- Behavior / sleep concerns
- Nutrition concerns
- Vomiting / diarrhea
- Discussion of Covid if your child has tested positive 

There are other symptoms that we can assist you with over Telemedicine so we welcome you to call our office for an appointment. The children seem to really enjoy having telemedicine visits as well! 

If you would like to schedule a Telemedicine Appointment for your child, please call to schedule just like an in-person appointment. 

If you have spoken to our front desk staff and have an appointment with a doctor for Telemedicine, you will be sent a link to the Telemedicine Encounter either through a text message if you plan to connect using your mobile device, or an email if you are going to use your laptop. 

We have found that connectivity is better when the Telemedicine visit is conducted on a laptop.  

We sincerely appreciate your patience if the doctor does not join you at the exact time of your Telemedicine appointment as the in-person appointments can run over due to the nature of pediatrics. Please call the front desk if you need assistance.
