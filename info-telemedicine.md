If you have spoken to our front desk staff and have an appointment with a doctor for telemedicine, please follow these steps. It is helpful if you are prepared with a flashlight, a thermometer, and are in a quiet, well lit location that has good WiFi.

**Step 1:** **[Please log into the patient portal](https://17596.portal.athenahealth.com/)**, click on "MESSAGES" in the top toolbar. You must reply to the message asking for consent to telemedicine by replying with the words "I consent".

**Step 2:** If you are on your smartphone or tablet, please go into the SETTINGS and choose the BROWSER you will use and ALLOW use of both the camera and microphone. You may need to restart your browser for the updates to take place. If you are on a camera-equipped laptop or a computer with a webcam, please do the same but in general this will pop up as a prompt. For Apple devices we have experienced the best results with the Safari web browser.

**Step 3:** **[Click this link to enter our Telemedicine waiting room](https://firststatepeds.doxy.me)**, choose the doctor you have an appointment with, enter your child's name and we will be with you shortly.
