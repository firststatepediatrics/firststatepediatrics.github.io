Welcome to First State Pediatrics! Previously "Kids First Newark" and "Kids First Hockessin", First State Pediatrics was established January 1, 2010 by five experienced board certified pediatricians in order to better serve our patients.
    	
#### Our Philosophy

Our goal is to establish a strong doctor-patient relationship with each family, and to earn your trust. We base our medical decisions on current treatment guidelines and evidence-based research. We aim to create a medical home environment, and to get to know your child personally. We strive to be gentle, accurate and punctual.

#### Convenience and Comfort

With convenient practice locations in Hockessin and Newark, First State Pediatrics is committed to providing premium pediatric care for infants through adolescents.&nbsp;We are proud to offer&nbsp;a modern and comfortable atmosphere for your children's medical needs at both locations.&nbsp;Your doctor will thoroughly evaluate your child and carefully&nbsp;answer your questions at every visit.

We utilize an electronic medical record for precise and secure documentation, as well as efficient electronic prescribing so that your child's medications are ready to pick up when you get to your pharmacy of choice.

#### Locations

Dr. John Murphy and Dr. Kathleen Leach, with their team of exceptional registered nurses and office staff, are pleased to offer state of the art medical care at their Newark location. We are happily accepting new patients of all ages at the Newark site.

Dr. Robert Olivieri, Dr. Amy Chang, and Dr. Lauren Healy, with their team of exceptional registered nurses and office staff, are pleased to offer state of the art medical care at their Hockessin location. We are happily accepting new patients of all ages at the Hockessin site.
