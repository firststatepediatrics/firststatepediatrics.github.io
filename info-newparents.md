Congratulations on your new baby! We excel at newborn infant care, and it is our pleasure to guide you during these exciting and challenging first weeks and months.

If you choose for us to be your pediatric practice, please notify the hospitalist newborn care provider at the hospital or birth center that we will be caring for your baby after discharge and they will forward the records to us. 

It is strongly recommended that all newborns have their first follow up appointment within 3-4 days after hospital discharge. Please call us as soon as possible after discharge to schedule the first appointment. At times it will be recommended at discharge that you bring your baby in sooner. We will try to accommodate these requests. Please be aware that we do not see newborns or any well child visits on the weekend, but we are available for telemedicine visits on Saturday mornings.
