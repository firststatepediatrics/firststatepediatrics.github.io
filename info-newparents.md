Congratulations on your new baby! We excel at newborn infant care, and it is our pleasure to guide you during these exciting and challenging first weeks and months.

If you deliver at Christiana Hospital, one of our five doctors will see your baby on the post-partum unit each morning until discharge. If you have your baby at another hospital or if your baby is a NICU graduate going home, please call to notify us so we can schedule their first appointment promptly. 

The Newark office has a monthly prenatal visit (offered as a group) if you would like to meet one of the doctors in the Newark office. Currently the Hockessin office is not able to accommodate prenatal appointments. Please call 368-2501 to be added to the monthly prenatal visit for Newark only.
