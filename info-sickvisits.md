title: Sick Visits and Calls

If your child is sick, injured or if you have any other concerns, please call the office. Same day appointments are available Monday through Friday at both offices; please call early in the day so that we can do our best to accommodate your child the same day.

If you have a question or are not sure if your child needs a sick visit, our registered nurses can assist you with phone advice, and if needed may call you back with physician advice.
