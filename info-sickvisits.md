title: Sick Visits and Calls

If your child is sick, injured or if you have any other concerns, please call the office. Same day appointments are available every day at both offices; please call early in the day so that we can do our best to accommodate your child the same day.

If you have a question or are not sure if your child needs a sick visit, our registered nurses can assist you with phone advice, and if needed may call you back with physician advice.

Saturday acute sick visits are available at the office of the on-call physician for the weekend. Please call your primary office Saturday starting at 8:30am for scheduling, and your call will be routed to the office seeing patients that day. Please note that on Saturdays, children are seen by appointment on a first come first served basis between 9:00am and 12:00pm. We only have one physician seeing urgent sick appointments on Saturdays and there is often a "wait" - please try to schedule an appointment during the week if your child has been sick for a while to help us keep the Saturday hours available for urgent appointments.
