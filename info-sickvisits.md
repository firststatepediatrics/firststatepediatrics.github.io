title: Sick Visits and Calls
---

If your child is sick, injured or if you have any other concerns, please call the office. Same day appointments are available every day at both offices; please call early in the day so that we can do our best to accommodate your child the same day.

If you have a question or are not sure if your child needs a sick visit, our registered nurses can assist you with phone advice, and if needed may call you back with physician advice.

COVID-19 Saturday information: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, First State Pediatrics suspended in-person Saturday AM office hours (9am-12noon) to limit potential exposure to illness in the office. The on-call physician is still available over Telemedicine for Saturday AM office hours.  

These telemedicine appointments are available for remote assessment of any urgent concerns, including but not limited to: fever, rash, skin infections, pink-eye, seasonal allergies, ear ache, sore throat and cough/cold. There are of course limitations to these remote encounters and sometimes a follow up in the office on the next business day, or emergency referral, is warranted. Surprisingly we have found that a number of conditions can be managed remotely since starting this service in the Spring. The remote connection is easy. You will need a laptop, tablet or phone with a camera and microphone to participate.
