All scheduled vaccines are thimerosol-free. We prefer to use the available combination vaccines to reduce the total number of injections. When there are shortages we substitue the individual component vaccines.

Vision screening, hearing screening, dipstick urinalysis, routine blood screening for anemia and lead exposure for infants, and cholesterol screening for adolescents, are performed or ordered per the guidelines of the American Academy of Pediatrics. 

Annual influenza vaccine is strongly recommended for all children age 6 months and older.

Please request all school or daycare forms during your well child visit. There is a nominal charge for forms requested in between visits.
