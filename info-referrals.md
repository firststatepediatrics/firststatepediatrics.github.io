Your child's heath is our priority. We strive to create a medical home environment for your child, and we are the hub of your child's comprehensive health care. When your child needs to see a specialist, we will work with you to choose the right specialist physician for your child's specific needs. We will review their consultation reports and contact you with any concerns.

Some insurances require a referral. Please call the office during routine business hours with all insurance referral requests. We require a minimum of 48 hours to complete routine referral requests. Please call as soon as you have the specialist's appointment information. Referrals are sent electronically. Referrals for emergency imaging or consultations will be handled expeditiously

We will need the following information to complete all referrals: the name and date of birth of your child, your current insurance information, the name of the specialist, the date and time of the appointment, and the reason for the consultation.
